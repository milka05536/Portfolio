  </h1>
  <h2>Title: SANNY - The place where your blood, health and calmness are important</h2>
  <img src = "firstimg.png" alt = "Intro image" width = "700">
  <h3>Overview / Context</h3>
  <p>Type: 24-hour Hackathon Project <br>
Team: 2 people (me + a friend)<br>
Tools: Figma, ChatGPT API (conceptually), brainstorming boards<br>
Timeframe: 24 hours<br>
Role: UX/UI Designer & Concept Developer
</p>
<p>During a 24-hour hackathon, my teammate and I developed an idea for a health-focused mobile app. The goal was to design an accessible, AI-powered platform that helps people interpret their blood test results in plain language and get lifestyle advice based on their data.
</p>
<h4>The Problem/Goal</h4>
<p>Many people receive blood test results filled with medical jargon they don’t understand. They either ignore them or turn to unreliable sources online,<br>
   which can increase anxiety and confusion.
Our goal was to create an app that:<br>
     <br>
- Helps users understand their blood test results in clear, simple terms.<br>
- Offers non-medical lifestyle advice to improve health naturally.<br>
- Provides guidance on which doctor to visit and nearest accessible locations if any value looks abnormal.<br>
- Allows users to ask AI health-related questions for reassurance and education.<br>
- Maintain a record of your medical history
</p>
<h4>Process & Iterations</h4>
<p>We developed the concept for an app designed to help users enhance their lifestyle and manage minor health concerns, particularly for those with busy schedules or limited access to timely medical care. The app provides guidance on lifestyle improvements and notifies users when it is advisable to consult a doctor promptly.
</p>
<p>We quickly researched existing apps (like Carrot Care, Ada, and Health Mate) to identify gaps.
</p>
<h4>Insights:</h4>
<p>- Most apps show only data without explanations<br>
- Few apps combine test analysis, AI chat, and actionable advice <br>
- Users want trustworthy yet friendly guidanc.<br>
</p>
<h4>Information Architecture & Wireframes</h4>
<p>We sketched the main flow:<br>
1. Upload/scan your blood test <br>
2. App analyzes results and highlights any issues <br>
3. Personalized advice and doctor recommendation <br>
4. Optional AI chat for follow-up questions <br>
</p>
<h4>App Flow Diagram</h4>

<h4>UI Design</h4>
<p>We focused on a calm, trustworthy, medical aesthetic—soft blues,greens and red, with icons for clarity. The minimalist logo clearly reflects the app’s core principles and functionality.<br>
Key screens:</p>

<h5>Intro screens guiding users through a quick personal info survey</h5>
<img src = "img3.png" alt = "Intro image" width = "700">
<h5>Screens showing illness history sharing, main dashboard, and user profile/settings menu </h5>
<img src = "img4.png" alt = "Intro image" width = "1200">
<h5>Flow showing how users upload their blood test, view the analysis, and see detailed results</h5>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>I was responsible for:<br>
- Defining the core concept and user goals<br>
- Developed the app’s main color palette and logo<br>
- Partially creating wireframes and final UI design in Figma<br>
   <br>
My teammate focused on UI design in Figma as well and AI integration logic
</p>
<h4>Solutions & Outcome</h4>
<p>Our final solution was an interactive app concept that:<br>

- Simplifies complex medical data into clear visuals and explanations<br>
- Warns users when values approach abnormal ranges<br>
- Suggests vitamins and habits to improve results naturally<br>
- Recommends which specialist to visit and suggest the nearest clinics<br>
- Includes a built-in AI medical assistant for minor concerns<br>
</p>
<h5>Outcome:</h5>
<p>
- Positive feedback from hackathon mentors: they appreciated the combination of AI + design empathy <br>
- We completed a Figma prototype within 24 hours<br>
- The app demonstrated potential for real-world health-tech use and could evolve into a start-up project
</p>
<h4>Personal Reflection</h4>
<p>This project taught me how to balance complex information with user-friendly design under time pressure. I learned the importance of clear visual hierarchy and trust-building design in health-related products.
If I were to continue the project, I’d conduct usability testing with actual users to validate the clarity of explanations and refine the AI chat flow for accessibility.

<h1>PROJECT 2</h1>
<h2>Title: Landing pages design </h2>
<h3>Overview/Context</h3>
<p>A one-page landing design created as part of a 4-day intensive course. The goal was to design a visually appealing and user-friendly landing pages for different companies.
  This project was part of a short design sprint that simulated real-world UI/UX tasks. I worked individually and applied basic principles of layout, typography, and visual hierarchy.
</p>
  <h4>The Problem / Goal</h4>
<p>The challenge was to design a simple yet engaging landing page that would attract users and encourage them to sign up. The goal was to make the interface clean, consistent, and modern while reflecting the wellness theme.
</p>
<h4>Process</h4>
<p>I followed step-by-step tutorials to learn how to create this design. Through the process, I practiced building layouts, choosing colors and typography, and understanding how small design decisions affect the overall user experience.</p>
<h4>UI design</h4>

<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>I was responsible for the entire design process — from initial concept and wireframes to final UI visuals.</p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>The final landing pages communicate simplicity and clarity, with clear calls to action and an appealing visuals. The layout guides the user naturally through key sections.</p>
<h4>Personal Reflection</h4>
<p>This project helped me understand how color balance, typography, and spacing affect readability and user perception. I also learned how to iterate quickly and apply feedback effectively.</p>
